# Learning Github

## Github

Git is an open-source version control system(VCS).

When developers create something they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.VCS keeps these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. 

It allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
